# Audio_generator_over_writing_spreadsheet
First of first, this script is to automatically simulate a set of audios according to one audio source.
Use the package pyacousticroom to simulate the audio source moving in the room at 16 different directions.
The file A includes quite a few audio source.
Then, the script reads the file A line by line and generates simulated data.
You may need to change the path if you want to practice this script.
